# TMXDownloader
## Massively download tracks from the TMX database

This is an extension for Chrome that was used to automatically download
tracks from the current TMX page. At the moment it only works in Chrome and doesn't have any bells and whistles. Adds a small "Download All" button at the bottom of every TMX result page.
